Welcome to the Clarion Metro Form Project!
==============================================

.. Note:: More than just a wizard now this project will probably be renamed to "Clarion Modern UI" or similar eventually.

.. Note:: The APP file included was created with Clarion8. 

About
-----

The project includes a set of classes and image resources that can be dropped onto a normal Clarion window which instantly transform it into a Modern UI style!

Inspiration comes directly from the `Silverlight Metro Style Wizard <https://github.com/stevenh77/MetroWizard>`_ project by `Steven Hollidge <http://stevenhollidge.com/>`_. I have not yet implemented the alternative style shown in the screenshot on the `GitHub Page <https://github.com/stevenh77/MetroWizard>`_ but that will be a nice alternative if I get a chance to add it one day!
